# har\_crawl

`har_crawl` lets you generate a documentation skeleton for a JSON API, listing
endpoints, parameters, example responses, and more, from an HTTP Archive (HAR)
file generated by your browserâ€™s devtools (network tab). Useful for learning
the structure of undocumented third-party APIs.

## Usage

`./crawl.py <HAR file> <API base URL> <output directory>`  
`./render.sh <output directory>`

First, run `crawl.py`, which will output a list of API endpoints and write
documentation files in GitHub-flavored markdown to the output directory. 

Then, if you have `pandoc` installed, you can run `./render.sh <output
directory>` to convert those markdown files to HTML. 

Finally, open `out/index.html` to see the generated documentation.

Note: if your HAR file includes requests to the same endpoint with different
URL or body parameters, that endpoint will be included multiple times in the
output documentation.
